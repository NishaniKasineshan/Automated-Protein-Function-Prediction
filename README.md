# Automated-Protein-Function-Prediction
AIM: Development of deep learning based models for Automated Protein Function Prediction with Gene Ontology.

Protein function, a concept encompassing cellular, molecular, and physiological activities, remains a challenge to precisely define due to its contextual nature. To address this complexity, various functional schemes have been proposed, aiming for broad coverage, standardized formats, hierarchical structures, disjoint categories, and dynamic adaptability. Among these, the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium has emerged as a pivotal contributor, offering a structured vocabulary with representative terms known as "GO terms." These terms categorize protein attributes into molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC), forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure that illustrates inheritance relationships.

The focal point of this project is the development of a model for accurately predicting protein function, represented as a list of GO terms, based on protein sequences. The objective is to devise a prediction model capable of assigning the most appropriate sub-graph of the gene ontology to each protein, generating prediction scores for these sub-graphs and/or individual predicted terms.

Protein function prediction is integral to various biological endeavors, including elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying drug targets. Traditionally, experimental methods were employed for function prediction, often targeting specific genes or proteins or small, naturally occurring protein groups like complexes. However, the low throughput nature of experimental approaches limits their ability to annotate the growing number of proteins generated by advances in genome sequencing. This limitation has spurred the development of computational techniques leveraging high-throughput experimental data sources such as protein and genome sequences, gene expression profiles, protein interaction networks, and phylogenetic profiles.

This project aims to advance computational methods, particularly through machine learning approaches, to directly predict the set of GO terms associated with a given protein. These methods may include models capable of extracting protein-function associations directly from biomedical literature. Accurate annotation of protein functions not only enhances our comprehension of molecular biology but also holds substantial biomedical and pharmaceutical implications, offering insights into life at the molecular level.
